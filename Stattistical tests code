#One-tailed Test Predicting a LOWER sample score for happiness

#Step 1: The hypotheses
#H0: μs = μP (Happiness sample mean is equal to the population mean)
#H1: μs < μP (Happiness sample mean is lower than the population mean)

#Step : Criteria for decision
#reject the null hypothesis if the z statistic is smaller than the critical value at α =0.05.
#α =.05
#the critical z-score is -1.65.

#Step 3: Collect data; compute sample statistics
#define vector to calculate standard deviation
data1 <- c(HappinessFile$Happiness)
#calculate standard deviation
HappinessStd <- sd(data1)
#calculate mean
HappinessMean <- mean(data1)
#calculate size
HappinessSize <- length(data1)
sqrtSize <- sqrt(HappinessSize)
SEM <- HappinessStd/sqrtSize
#SEM = 0.1077
#sample statistic
SampleStatisticHapp <- (HappinessMean-5.43)/(SEM)
#Z test statistic = -0.3448
 
#Step 4 Decision
#The z statistic -0.3448 is larger than the critical value which is -1.65 as a result we do
#not reject the null hypothesis. In this case the sample mean is not significantly from the population mean.

# a type 1 error may occur if I reject a null hypothesis in an instance where it is true.
# The risk of a type 1 error in this hypothesis test is 5%.
#If I had done a non directional (2-tailed) hypothesis testing with an alpha level α =.05 the critical value would be +/-1.960 
# I would have still not rejected the null hypothesis since the z statistic is not extreme and lies within the range +/-1.960.


#One-tailed Test Predicting a LOWER sample score for FreeLifeChoice 

#Step 1: The hypotheses 
#H0: μs = μP (FreeLifeChoice  sample mean is equal to the population mean)
#H1: μs > μP (FreeLifeChoice  sample mean is larger than the population mean)

#Step 2: criteria for decision
#reject the null hypothesis if the z statistic is larger than the critical value at α =0.05.
#α =.05
#the critical z-score is 1.65.

#SEM2 = 0.0129

#Z test statistic = 0.5130

#Step 4 Decision
#The z statistic 0.5130 is smaller than the critical value which is 1.65 as a result we do

#Two-tailed Test Predicting a DIFFERENT sample score for Generosity.
#Step 1: The hypotheses 
#H0: μs = μP (Generosity  sample mean is equal to the population mean)
#H1: μs ≠ μP (Generosity  sample mean is different from the population mean)

#Step 2: criteria for decision
#reject the null hypothesis if the z statistic is extreme in that it is larger than the upper critical value or smaller than the lower critical value at α =0.05.
#α =.05
#the critical z-score is +/-1.960.

#Step 3: Collect data; compute sample statistics

#Z test statistic = 0.8213

#Step 4 Decision
#The z statistic 0.8213 is smaller than the upper critical value which is 1.960 as a result we do
#not reject the null hypothesis. In this case the sample mean is not significantly different from the population mean.
